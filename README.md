The reason why i used another object to track (pear instead of rollers) is because my computer is weak and it couldn’t do the training with the initial object. Since i was running out of time, i couldn’t tell someone else to do it for me so i just chose an easier object (pear) and i also trained the model with less images(30 instead of 50) just so my computer doesn’t crash. These are a lot of restrictions but it was the only way to make it work.

You can find my model on this link because i couldn't downoald it on github ; https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_FvCDQX8HJR1cJwvcomf0CrIk4Ff8t4i?usp=share_link
